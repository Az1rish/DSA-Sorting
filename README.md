1. [21, 1, 26, 45, 29, 28, 2, 9, 16, 49, 39, 27, 43, 34, 46, 40]
    a. after 3 recursive calls - left = [21], right = [1]
    b. after 16 recursive calls - should be solved after 15 recursive calls.
    c. [21] and [1]
    d. [21, 1, 26, 45] and [29, 28, 2, 9]

2.  The pivot point could've been either  14 or 17 as in either case everything to the left of them is less than them and everything to the right is greater than.

3.  a. if last item is pivot the array will be [3,  9, 10, 12, 19, 14, 17, 16, 13, 15]
